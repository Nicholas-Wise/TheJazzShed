              <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">My name is Dave Pagdonsolan. I will be a 4th year Jazz Studies
              Education student at CapU in Fall 2022. I have been playing
              trombone for 8 years. I have been an avid listener of the jazz
              music ever since I joined my high school's jazz band. I have since
              chosen the path of becoming a future music educator because of my
              love for music!
              </p>

            <br>

            <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Two of my most favourite jazz improvisers are Andy Martin and
            Marshall Gilkes. I like Andy Martin because of his creative lines
            and use of doodle tonguing. I enjoy listening to Marshall Gilkes
            because of his tone and expressiveness in his improv. I also
            recommend listening to Carl Fontana, Bill Watrous, Steve Davis,
            and Michael Dease for improv ideas (and for good jazz!).</p>

              <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Hi, my name is Nicholas Wise. I am an alto saxoponist heading into my fourth year in Capilano University's Jazz Performance and Composition progrom this fall with a 4.0 GPA.
                For me, improvisation is one of the most captivating and important aspects of jazz and it is often glossed over in high school music education.
                This is the reason I wanted to create this website with my good friend Dave!
              </p>

            <br>

              <p class="fs-5 lh-lg"> Two of my favourite musicians are Cannonball Adderley and Kenny Garrett.
                Cannonball is the largest influence on my musical development up to this point in my studies, and for good reason. His second-to-none articulation, along with his phrasing,
               time feel, and soulful musicality are reasons as to why he is a legendary figure in jazz music. I recommend listening to his album "Live at the Lighthouse".
               Kenny Garrett is an amazing modern alto saxophonist and composer/arranger whose harmonic and rhythmic ideas never cease to amaze me. I recommend listening to his album "Songbook".
